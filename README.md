## Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Black Friday sales dataset. The project aims to explore the dataset, gain insights, and visualize various aspects related to sales on Black Friday using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Black Friday sales dataset, which contains information about transactions made by customers on Black Friday. It includes various features such as customer demographics (age, gender, marital status), product categories, purchase amounts, and more.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `BlackFridaySale_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process.
- `BlackFriday_Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and any necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of variables.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and multicolumn analyses to explore relationships between different features and analyze sales patterns.

## Analysis Questions

Some of the analysis questions addressed in this project include:

- Gender distribution among customers
- Amount spent by different age groups
- Average spending per age group
- Marital status distribution
- City category distribution
- Amount spent in each city
- Average spending by customers in each city
- Stay_In_Current_City_Years column analysis
- Gender distribution among residents in each city
- Relationship between city category and marital status
- etc.

## How to Use

To run the EDA notebook:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries mentioned : Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn
3. Open `BlackFridaySale_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and explore the dataset.
